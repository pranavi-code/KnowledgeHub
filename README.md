# 🚀 KnowledgeHub – Centralized Knowledge & Onboarding Platform for Engineering Teams

KnowledgeHub is a smart and modern web platform that helps fast-paced technical teams manage and retain critical knowledge. It offers a centralized space for storing code artifacts, documents, onboarding guides, and project updates — ensuring teams never lose important information again.

## 🧠 Problem It Solves

In most organizations, knowledge is scattered across chats, inboxes, folders, and local notes. When developers leave, switch teams, or new ones join, that knowledge often disappears — leading to confusion, slow onboarding, and repeated mistakes.

🔎 **KnowledgeHub** solves this with:
- Centralized storage of all engineering knowledge  
- Easy-to-follow onboarding paths for new devs  
- Fast, filtered search for all project artifacts
